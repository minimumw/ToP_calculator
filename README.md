# ToP_calculator

Calculator project for The Odin Project

Overall Thoughts

Went much smoother than expected. Getting a much better understanding of CSS just by doing these projects. Still feels clunky, but reaching a desired outcome more quickly.

Didn't rely near as heavily on googling solutions. Still googled, but it was more to clarify how to do something/syntax and not explicity how to program logic

Biggest challenges were chaining operations (12 + 3 x 7 ...) which i almost immediately had an epiphany on after i moved on to the = event listener (operate function) and some of the bugs/edge cases (dividing by zero, stopping user from inputting more than one '.' ). Solved these by just slowing down and walking through logic step by step

All in all, happy with project, espically having the calculator fill the extire screen on mobile so it seems more like a native app (super simple media query, but still looks cool).

Things I may want to come back and add:

- A better font for display (digital clock font)
- Refactor some logic (some of it looks janky and could probably be simplfied)
- Keyboard support

Things to review/better understand :

- Operations object
- Rounding to x decimal place
